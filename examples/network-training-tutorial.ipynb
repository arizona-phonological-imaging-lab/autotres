    "\n",

We will encode this database key as a list of the form `['study','frame']`. While you might construct a key of additional fields (ex. `subject`), the last element will usually be frame, since that is usually the minimal unit of analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these names are arbitrary, as long as you are consistant. Of course using informative names is best practice, since `autotres` has some sensible defaults that rely on certain keys; for example, the default code for extracting images from video relies on a `'frame'` key."

    "\n",
    "Next, we need to be able to tell autotres about the types of files we have, the types of data they represent, and what levels of the key heirarchy each piece of data should be associated with. This will mostly be accomplished with regular expressions. We create a dict of data types. The keys of the dict represent data type names. Note that we will want one type for each type of data we want, not for each type of file we have. `autotres` is perfectly happy pulling more than one type of information from a file. \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, If I have multiple tracers on my team, then I would expect to have multiple 'trace' files for each combination of 'subject' and 'frame'. In this case, I would like to keep all of the traces for the same image, so that I can do something sensible with it, like interpolate. In this case I will set the value for 'conflict' to 'list'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if I have conducted multiple studies with my dataset, one looking at coronals and one looking at fricatives, I would expect to have multiple copies of the images for coronal fricatives. However, unlike the instance with multiple traces, `fricative_frame-00042.png` and `coronal_frame-00042.png` should be identical files. I can use the 'hash' option to specify that I should ignore duplicates as long as they are the same, but should raise an exception if they don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are some situations that I simply expect not to happen. For example, if a single subject is associated with more that one 'audio' file, then perhaps it is most likely that somebdy mislabeled something. In this case, I would not set 'conflict' to anything, and if there is a conflict, autotres will raise an exception automatically\n",

    "#### `'regex'`: How to associate each file with a combination of heirachical levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a regular expression that will match a filename in the dataset. We use the `(?P<label>...)` syntax to capture parts of the filename that are informative. Specifically, we need to be able to infer all the relevent heirarchical information from the file name. This should be a left-substring of the keys list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the regex is matched to the entire pathname, relative to whatever path we give it (see below). Here, we have also used the `(?x)` flag to allow us to break the regex over multiple lines, and to include comments."
